## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS GRID Layout
- Media queries


### What I learned

Working with images in a way that they are responsive has been a challenge since i start. I tried my best to make the component more responsible i could, but i think that's plenty room for improvment. My aproach was mobile-first and i think in that cenario a suceed.

### Continued development

From now own my main goal is to continue improve my CSS and HTML skill and now i'm learning JS, integrate it to my works.


### Useful resources


- [Guide to Flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot, because it's so visual. Anyone can understand display:flex with this guide.
- [GRID cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/) - This sheet it's always useful for remeber the properties of display:grid
